                                As Tech Directory of HackTheU, I led a team of web developers in a complete frontend
                                overhaul, including a brand new responsive website served via CloudFlare CDN, a live IRC
                                chat server for use during events, and a help queueing system; all hosted on Amazon AWS
                                with the use of Docker. I also secured the organization's systems from attacks,
                                including those stemming from often mis-configured email DNS settings. Lastly, I took
                                key part in seeking out venues and organizing the logistics of said events.

                                Upon starting my college career at the University of Utah, I noticed a severe lack of
                                communication between students of the School of Computing. For this reason, I started a
                                chatroom exclusively for computer science students. I have spent countless hours of my
                                life managing this chatroom with over 250 student members, helping students to
                                understand
                                concepts and assignments in any class I can, from early beginner classes to the most
                                advanced.

                                To help me moderate the chatroom, I have heavily automated the chatroom through a <a

                                bot</a> that I developed using Java Spring Boot and the Discord APIs. Students, TAs, and
                                Professors are automatically placed into roles and chatrooms based on their enrollment
                                status.
