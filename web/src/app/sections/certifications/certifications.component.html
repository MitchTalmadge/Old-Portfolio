                I have currently passed the following assessments, with more to come as I find the time:

                I took these exams in high school while studying at an applied technology center, and took first place for the state of Utah with my scores for Software Development Fundamentals.

            <hr/>
            <p>
                My goal throughout high school was to take as many vocational classes as I could to build
                up my skills. Many of my friends spent all their time miserably slaving away in AP classes so that
                they could graduate faster, but to what end? I decided to take classes that would actually have a lasting impact on my life.
