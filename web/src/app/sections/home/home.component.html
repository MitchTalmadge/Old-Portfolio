                Welcome! My name is Mitch. I'm a Facebook intern, full-time BS/MS Computer Science student, and aspiring NASA Astronaut.

                I have a passion for Hawaiian, and I am always looking for ways to help revive this beautiful and
                forgotten language.
                In my free time I love to weld, fix cars, build electronics, and help others.
