            <p>
                At the University of Utah I was awarded multiple scholarships, founded a startup that was a finalist
                in two competitions, and was on the Dean's list for every semester of my Undergraduate degree in
                Computer Science.

            <p>
                In high school I competed with students from schools all across the state for the title of Sterling Scholar.
                Out of hundreds of very talented students, I had the honor of taking first place in the Computer Technology category.

                In my first year of high school, I competed in the Central Utah Science & Engineering Fair (CUSEF) by
                submitting a project that my long-time friend and I had worked on since the beginning of middle school.
                We created MinecraftK12, an educational platform that turned Minecraft into a teaching tool.
                Our project won first place and awards from Intel and BYU.

                In Middle School I maintained a 4.0 GPA while learning advanced programming languages for my age, like Prolog and Java.
                I also worked as a member of the stage crew and helped diagnose technology issues with lighting and sound.
