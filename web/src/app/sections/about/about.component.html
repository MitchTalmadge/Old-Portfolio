            <h2>Computer Science, Kayaking, and Space</h2>
            <p>
                Aloha! My name is Mitch. From a very young age I've been pretty much obsessed with computers. How do they work? What else can they do? Questions like 
                these drove me down a never-ending path of self-discovery which has led to countless awards, certificates, and an insurmountable level of experience
                working with a large range of technologies spanning from embedded IoT firmware to distributed cloud infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from the University of Utah in 2022 with my Master's in Computer Science the top 8% of my class. Today, I work as a Senior Software
                Engineer at ConexED. I love what I do, and I am constantly expanding my skills. When I get the chance, I love to visit the pacific northwest and 
                spend my days in the mountains and my evenings in a kayak on the lake.
            </p>
            <p>
                My dream in life is to join the ranks of NASA astronauts who have ventured to the moon, and do my part towards ensuring the future of 
                the human civilization on celestial bodies outside of our Earth. This is a challenging dream which makes my Master's degree look easy in comparison. 
                In preparation for this, I am constantly furthering my knowledge and abilities in water survival, physics, piloting, and hands-on skills like welding 
                and mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is a showcase of my hard work and determination that has gotten me to where I am today. Take a look around and feel free to shoot me a message.
                Mahalo for stopping by!
